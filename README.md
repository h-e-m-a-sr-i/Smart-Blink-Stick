# Smart Blink Stick Using Arduino

This is an assistive device built for visually impaired individuals. It uses an ultrasonic sensor and a buzzer to detect obstacles and provide real-time audio feedback.

## 👩‍💻 Technologies Used
- Arduino UNO
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- Buzzer
- Breadboard, Jumper Wires

## ⚙️ How It Works
The sensor measures distance to obstacles. If an object is detected within a threshold, the buzzer activates.

## 🚀 Setup
1. Connect the components as shown in the image below.
2. Upload the `blink_stick_code.ino` file to Arduino using Arduino IDE.
3. Power on and test with nearby obstacles.
